i tested a trivial 2 line makefile with different Wine versions and got errors

make.exe is GNU Make 4.4.1 (Win32)
from the Chocolatey Windows Packages (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/make#files, MD5: 05c9160399e59141f82850cfeb3f875c)

just run `make` in this folder

makefile
```
clean:
	del *.not_existing_at_all
```

up-to-date Windows 10 ===> **OK**

```
D:\temp\bug_repo0>make.exe
del *.not_existing_at_all
D:\temp\bug_repo0\*.not_existing_at_all konnte nicht gefunden werden <=== feedback from the Windows del command that there are no such files
```

up-to-date Ubuntu 24.10 (up-to-date) + `sudo apt install wine32` => wine 9.0 ===> **OK**


```
wine make.exe
wine: Read access denied for device L"\\??\\Z:\\", FS volume label and serial are not available.
del *.not_existing_at_all
*.not_existing_at_all: File Not Found  <=== feedback from Wine del command - same as on Windows
```

up-to-date WSL2/SUSE Tumbleweed + `sudo zypper install wine` => wine 10.0 ===> **NO OK**


```
wine make.exe
del *.not_existing_at_all
make: *** [makefile:2: clean] Error 1  <=== make returns an error 
```

up-to-date Fedora 42 (Beta) + `sudo dnf install wine32` => wine 10.4 ===> **NO OK**


```
wine make.exe
002c:fixme:winediag:loader_init wine-staging 10.4 is a testing version containing experimental patches.
002c:fixme:winediag:loader_init Please mention your exact version when filing bug reports on winehq.org.

del *.not_existing_at_all
make: *** [makefile:2: clean] Error 1  <=== make returns an error 
```

so it seems that Win 10.x maybe introduced some problem that occures only with using make.exe this way

comparing the output of `make.exe -d > out.txt 2>&1` between Wine 10.0 (left) and Windows (right) shows some "Reaping" problems
